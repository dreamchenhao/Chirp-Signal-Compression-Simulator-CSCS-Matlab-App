# CSCS
### CSCS (Chirp Signal Compression Simulator) is a Matlab application for easily simulate the single/multi-target chirp signal compression.  

Double click .mlappinstall to install the Matlab application.  
Need Matlab R2014a or newer version. (Recommend R2016a)  

**Step 1:** Chirp Set - Set the basic chirp.  
First, determine the bandwidth, pulse duration, sampling frequency and chirp form you want, it will display a simple basic chirp waveform s(t), and results of the output signal compressed after a default, corresponding matched filter h(t). It will auto update the results when you change the initial setting. Then it will use this basic waveform for both of the single and multiple targets simulation.  

**Step 2:** Targets - Set ranges of targets  
Second, assume that all of the targets are on the ground range, input the radar height, incidence angle, and ranges between the near range and targets, check if it can be identified by compressing the combination signal after the matched filter.
